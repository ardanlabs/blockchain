## Description

This class teaches you how to build a semantically correct blockchain in Go. The implementation of the Ardan blockchain takes inspiration from both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The class is a mix of lecture and coding. During the class you will learn the different aspects of blockchain technology and pair program with the instructor as you build this code base from scratch.

Please look at the [wiki](https://github.com/ardanlabs/blockchain/wiki) for more details.

## Our Experience

We have taught Go to thousands of developers all around the world since 2014. There is no other company that has been doing it longer and our material has proven to help jump-start developers 6 to 12 months ahead of their knowledge of Go. We know what knowledge developers need in order to be productive and efficient when writing software in Go.

Our classes are perfect for intermediate-level developers who have at least a few months to years of experience writing code in Go. Our classes provide a very deep knowledge of the programming langauge with a big push on language mechanics, design philosophies and guidelines. We focus on teaching how to write code with a priority on consistency, integrity, readability and simplicity. We cover a lot about “if performance matters” with a focus on mechanical sympathy, data oriented design, decoupling and writing/debugging production software.

## More About Go

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. Although it borrows ideas from existing languages, it has a unique and simple nature that make Go programs different in character from programs written in other languages. It balances the capabilities of a low-level systems language with some high-level features you see in modern languages today. This creates a programming environment that allows you to be incredibly productive, performant and fully in control; in Go, you can write less code and do so much more.

Go is the fusion of performance and productivity wrapped in a language that software developers can learn, use and understand. Go is not C, yet we have many of the benefits of C with the benefits of higher level programming languages.

## Important Reading

Please check out this page of [important reading](.documentation/reading/README.md). You will find articles and videos around topics related to this repo.

## Before You Come To Class

The following is a set of tasks that can be done prior to showing up for class.  We will also do this in class if anyone has not completed it.  However, the more attendees that complete this ahead of time the more time we have to cover additional training material.

### Prep Work

**You will get the most out of this advanced Go class if you have taken the Ultimate Go and Service classes first.**

The Ultimate Go and Service classes are critical classes to understanding the code in this class.  
[Ultimate Go Classes](https://www.ardanlabs.com/ultimate-go/#tabpanel)  
[Scholarship](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSchEz6zg1fseR2XiIZgNB8Qm2a5JDB7n3EOWX5GeIP18OstaQ/viewform)  

This is a free and great class to learning concepts behind blockchains. Watch videos 1, 2, 6 and 8.

### Joining the Go Slack Community

We use a Slack channel to share links, code, and examples during the training.  This is free.  This is also the same Slack community you will use after training to ask for help and interact with may Go experts around the world in the community.

1. Using the following link, fill out your name and email address: https://invite.slack.gobridge.org/
1. Check your email, and follow the link to the slack application.
1. Join the training channel by clicking on this link: https://gophers.slack.com/messages/training/
1. Click the “Join Channel” button at the bottom of the screen.

### Installing the Training Material

While many of the examples can be done using the online playground (http://play.golang.org), some may find it easier to complete them with their local editor.  To do so, you will want to load the training material locally to your machine.  From a command prompt, issue the following commands:

```
$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir code
$ cd code
$ git clone https://github.com/ardanlabs/blockchain
$ cd blockchain
```
